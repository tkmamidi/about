    subtitle: Variant Analysis for Rare Diseases
    intro: >
      I work in a small team of 6 analysts (which includes our PI, Dr. EA Worthey) that comb through molecular data derived from DNA or RNA sequencing. The goal is to identify variations that could lead to specific symptoms or diseases seen in each patient. For each case two analysts are assigned. With the aid of our in-house developed software and other resources, I identify suspect variation(s), gather evidence on why that variation would lead to a specific symptom or disease, and subsequently present my findings to the entire team. In turn, each variation is judged by the team whether it should be reported to the doctor, collaborator, and/or the patient. Below is a brief description of some of the projects I work on.
    assignments:
      - title: Cystic Fibrosis
        link: "#"
        tagline: "CF patients, even those within a family with the same primary CFTR variants causing their CF, often have widely varying courses of disease. Our study aims to identify additional molecular variation that modifies the course of CF to account for these differences. Our ultimate goal may allow treating physicians to use each patient’s molecular data to predict the best course of therapy and to avoid CF complications."

      - title: Prader-Willi Syndrome
        link: "#"
        tagline: "In collaboration with the patient support and advocacy group, the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research, our team is using whole genome sequence and RNA-Seq data to find molecular causes for the wide differences in symptoms that PWS patients suffer daily. Molecular findings from a study of this type can lead to new therapies for treatment of the many symptoms experienced by these patients (often through drug repurposing). Discovery of new effective treatments can then be prescribed in an individualized therapy to increase the quality of life for these profoundly affected patients and their families."

      - title: Pediatric Cancer Outcomes
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Anthracycline-based cancer therapies are highly effect in curing many childhood cancers. Unfortunately, treatment with these cardiotoxic drugs has been known to cause life-threatening heart disease in a subset of the children. Statistically, ~50% of those who develop heart disease will die within 5 years. Our analysis comb through the genetic data of both cases and matched controls identifying both rare variation that occurs in single patients, and more common molecular variation that occurs at a statistically increased frequency in those with heart disease. The goals are to identify before initiating their cancer treatment children at risk and methods to halt development of heart disease."

      - title: Hepatic Cellular Carcinoma
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Identification of variants with links to cancer/HCC/liver disease to aid in increased understanding of the disease to improve patient’s outcomes."

      - title: Neuromuscular disease
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Identification of causal variation in patients with several distinct forms of neuromuscular disease which leads to muscle degeneration."

      - title: Undiagnosed Diseases Network
        link: "#"
        tagline: "Working with clinicians from many institutions and specialties to provide definitive molecular diagnoses for patients with rare, misdiagnosed or undiagnosed diseases by extracting knowledge from associated ‘omic data."
